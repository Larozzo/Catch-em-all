💻 Usage

To use this library you can import the modulino module along with the desired classes which give you access to the different modulinos. For example:

from modulino import ModulinoPixels

pixels = ModulinoPixels()

Once the desired object is obtained you can call functions and query properties on these objects such as pixels.set_all_rgb(255, 0, 0).
